# Two-predictor regression visualisation ðŸ“ˆ

Interactive 3D visualisation of a regression plane with two predictors and an interaction term.
Users can change the values of the regression coefficients by dragging it from side to side; the shape of the regression plane smoothly responds to change.
Hovering over/tapping the plane shows additional information.
